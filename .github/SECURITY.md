# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

LunaticChat only supports the latest version at any given time.
Older versions are not supported, and backports will not be provided unless absolutely necessary.

### In Minecraft

The Minecraft version follows the `api-version` on which the latest LunaticChat runs. However, it fundamentally depends on the Paper API / Velocity API version.

(Example: If the `api-version` is `1.21`, operation on `1.21.X` is guaranteed.)
