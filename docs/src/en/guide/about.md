# About LunaticChat

LunaticChat is a chat plugin for the Minecraft server software Paper/Velocity.

In 2013, [ucchyocean](https://github.com/ucchyocean) released [LunaChat](https://github.com/ucchyocean/LunaChat). LunaticChat is developed as a successor to LunaChat, rewritten from scratch to work with the latest versions.

LunaChat is no longer being developed and does not support the latest Minecraft versions. While many server administrators have forked LunaChat, LunaticChat is designed as an alternative that inherits LunaChat's features while being designed to work with the latest Minecraft versions.

## Key Features

- **Lightweight and Fast**: LunaticChat is designed to maintain high performance while minimizing server load.
- **1-on-1 Direct Messaging**: Chat one-on-one using /tell or /msg commands.
- **Quick Reply**: Quickly reply to the most recent message sender with /reply.
- **Japanese Romanization Conversion**: Automatically converts messages input in romaji to Japanese.
- **CoreProtect Support**: LunaticChat's chat logs are compatible with CoreProtect.
- **High-Speed Performance with Caching**: Uses caching for romaji-to-Japanese conversion, operating faster than traditional LunaChat.
- **Latest Version Support**: Reduces dependencies on other plugins, always supporting the latest Minecraft versions.
