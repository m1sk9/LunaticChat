# Velocity Integration (Cross-Server Chat) <Badge type="tip" text="v1.0.0" /> <Badge type="warning" text="Experimental" />

This feature enables cross-server chat between Paper servers connected through a Velocity proxy server.

::: warning Experimental Feature

This feature is currently implemented experimentally, and specifications may change in future updates.

Since this is a large-scale feature, we plan to implement it gradually rather than all at once.

For detailed implementation plans, see the [Roadmap (m1sk9/LunaticChat #54)](https://github.com/m1sk9/LunaticChat/issues/54).
