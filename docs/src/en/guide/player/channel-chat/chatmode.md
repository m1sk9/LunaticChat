# Chat Mode

Chat mode refers to the mode in which players send chat messages in LunaticChat. LunaticChat has the following two types of chat modes:

1. Global chat mode: Share chat with all players.
2. Channel chat mode: Share chat with players in a specific channel you have joined.

## Channel Chat Mode

While in channel chat mode, all chat messages are displayed only to players in the channel you have joined and will not be displayed in global chat.

::: tip Temporarily Send to Global Chat

If you want to temporarily send a message to global chat while in channel chat mode, prefix your message with `!`.

```
!Hello everyone, how are you?
```

## Global Chat Mode

While in global chat mode, you share chat with all players on the server. It functions the same as normal Minecraft chat.

## Temporarily Switching Chat Modes

To temporarily switch chat modes, use the `/chatmode toggle` command.

When you switch using this command, you can change chat modes without joining or leaving channels.
